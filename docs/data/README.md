# Measurement data

The numbers behind `DESIGN.md` ("Measurements") and
[benchmarks](../benchmarks.md), one CSV per experiment, for charts and for
comparing later runs. Environments (E1-mem, E1-disk, E2) are described in
`DESIGN.md`; each file says which it used. Times are in the unit its column
names (`_us`, `_ms`, `_s`); memory is in MiB (2^20 bytes); empty cells were
not measured or do not apply. Every number comes from one run of a release
build unless the file says otherwise; on E1, runs vary by about ±20%.

`python docs/charts/build.py` draws the charts of
[performance](../performance.md) from these files (light and dark SVG in
`docs/assets/charts/`). To add a run, keep the columns, add rows with a new date (or a new file
for a new environment), and say in `DESIGN.md` what changed.
